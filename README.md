# auraxis-bot

A Discord bot to look up stats and information from Planetside 2

## Invite

The bot can be added to your server with [this invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=437756856774033408&permissions=1330192&scope=bot+applications.commands).

## Structure

The main event listener for Discord messages is in `main.js`, it starts additional listeners in `unifiedWSListener.js` which each listen for events from the Daybreak Stream API for a given platform (PC, PS4US, PS4EU).  Most commands have their functionality separated into their own files, and utilize async to support high message volume.  Database structure is defined in `dbStructure.sql`.

## Usage

The bot is designed to be simple to use.  Once added to your server with the [invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=437756856774033408&permissions=1330192&scope=bot+applications.commands), commands can be viewed with `/help`.  In order to get the most out of the bot, please grant it the "Read Messages", "Send Messages", "Embed Links", and "Use External Emoji" permissions.  In addition for slash commands to display emoji the @everyone role must have the "Use External Emoji" permission granted in that channel, regardless of the bot's permissions.

## Self hosting

A `.env` file is used for the environment variables, including the [Discord Token](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me), [Daybreak Census API service ID](https://census.daybreakgames.com/), Postgres URL (optional).  Subscription functionality will be disabled if a database URL is not present.  If using Postgres, be sure to load the `dbStructure.sql` schema manually before starting the bot.

Your `.env` file should look something like this

```env
token = <Discord Token>
clientID = <Discord Client ID>
serviceID = <PS2 Census Service ID>
DATABASE_URL = <Postgres URL>
USER_AGENT = <User Agent for fetch requests>
```

After initial startup, run `node registerCommands.js` once to register the bot's commands with Discord.

To add the bot to your server, use an invite link of the form `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<Discord Client ID>8&permissions=1330192&scope=bot+applications.commands`.

As of [November 2023](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/issues/5279#issuecomment-1791484693), bots no longer have access to external emoji in guilds of which they are not members.  This means if you are self-hosting, you need to add all necessary emoji to your server.  Copies of the emoji are in `images/`.  Once you have done this, copy `static/emoji.json` to `static/emoji.local.json`, replace the emoji IDs with the ones from your server, and restart the bot.

## FAQ

### Why is the bot not posting in my server?

Please make sure you have granted it the "Read Messages" "Send Messages" and "Embed Links" permissions in the channel you are using it in.

### Why am I not seeing slash commands?

Certain servers will need to re-invite the bot to enable slash commands.  If you've done that, make sure that the "Use Application Commands" permission is granted for users in the appropriate channel.

### The bot is responding, but I'm not seeing any info

In your client settings, under "Text & Images" make sure "Show website preview info from links pasted into chat" is enabled

### Why am I seeing ":VS:", ":NC:", ":TR:", etc.?

The bot is not allowed to use external emoji in that channel, to fix this grant the Use External Emoji permission to the bot.

### What is IVI score?  How is it calculated?

IVI stands for "Infantry vs Infantry" and is one measure of "shooting skill" calculated by multiplying accuracy and headshot ratio.  Only weapons sanctioned under "infantry" in the community run sanction list and with more than 50 kills will be used in calculating IVI.  The stat as calculated per weapon is available in /stats as AHR (for Accuracy*Headshot Ratio) and is shown regardless of weapon sanction or number of kills.
